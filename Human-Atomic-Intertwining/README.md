## 🔍 Overview

This repository accompanies the preprint _"General Theory of Human Atomic Intertwining"_, a theoretical framework that proposes quantum-level entanglement—via proposed particles termed **Broctytes**—as a basis for seemingly coincidental human encounters. It introduces the concept of **entanglement renewal** to explain why certain individuals repeatedly reconnect in non-random ways.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Broctyte**: A hypothetical quantum particle encoding interpersonal entanglement.
- **Entanglement Renewal**: A dynamic pull between entangled individuals that subtly influences motion or behavior.
- **Synchronous Coincidences**: Repeated or meaningful encounters that exceed statistical probability.
